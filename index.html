    </h1>
    <h3>Cybers Security refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Cybersecurity measures are put in place to prevent unauthorized access, ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, and to maintain the overall functionality of computer systems and networks.</h3>

      <h3>Cybersecurity encompasses a wide range of technologies, processes, and practices designed to defend against cyber threats. This includes network security, which involves protecting networks and their infrastructure from unauthorized access or misuse; endpoint security, which focuses on securing individual devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets; application security, which involves securing software applications and preventing vulnerabilities; data security, which involves protecting data from unauthorized access, theft, or corruption; and identity and access management, which involves managing and controlling user access to systems and data.</h3>
